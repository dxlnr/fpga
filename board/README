# Steps so far 
 - Build Yosys from scratch (added to path) 
 - nextpnr-xilinx which is the example (build it and performed the steps for building the .bin)
    - check the xilinx/example/arty-a35
- build prjxray 
    - .download.sh : prjxray-db
    - pip install . in thirdparty/fasm
    - pip install . (in root)
    - make build (in root) -> adjust CMAKELists.txt by moving the set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDART 14) under option(PRJXRAY_BUILD_TESTING "" OFF) for absl fix  
    - cd build -> cmake -DARCH=xilinx -DBUILD_GUI=no -DBUILD_PYTHON=no . -> make
